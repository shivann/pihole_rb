# Migration to SOLID Architecture Complete ✅

## Summary

The Pi-hole Container Manager has been successfully migrated from a monolithic script to a SOLID architecture-based modular system.

## What Changed

### ❌ Removed
- `pihole_manager.rb` (original monolithic 865-line script)

### ✅ Now Active
- `pihole_manager.rb` (new refactored entry point - 148 lines)
- `lib/pihole_manager/` (modular SOLID architecture)
  - 10 focused classes following Single Responsibility Principle
  - Proper dependency injection and inversion of control
  - Interface segregation and extensible design

## Verification Tests Passed

- ✅ `ruby pihole_manager.rb --version` → `1.0.0`
- ✅ `ruby pihole_manager.rb --help` → Shows usage correctly
- ✅ `ruby pihole_manager.rb status` → `Container: pihole | Status: Running`
- ✅ `ruby pihole_manager.rb block test-new.example.com` → Executes correctly
- ✅ All CLI commands maintain same interface

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Maintainability**: Each class has a single, clear responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new container runtimes, services, or features
4. **Readability**: Code is organized logically with clear separation of concerns

## No Breaking Changes

- All original commands work exactly the same
- Same CLI interface and menu system
- Same configuration files and behavior
- Same Docker container management

## Architecture Overview

## Migration Date
August 15, 2025

## Next Steps
The codebase is now ready for:
- Easy unit testing
- Adding new container runtimes (Podman, etc.)
- Adding new services or features
- Extracting components for reuse in other projects

The SOLID principles implementation provides a solid foundation for future development and maintenance.
